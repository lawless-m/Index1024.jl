Example Indexing of a CSV file
==============================

# The Data

The CSV file I wish to index contains the data from the UK Land Registry. 
https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-the-price-paid-data
This records the value of every house sale in England and Wales. I have gathered the data from 2000 onwards and extracted the following dataset. The postcode, year and price of every transaction.

What I want is to be able to extract the list of year / price entries for a particular postcode.

postcode,year,price       
AL10 0AB,2000,63000       
AL10 0AB,2003,126500      
AL10 0AB,2003,167000      
AL10 0AB,2003,177000      
AL10 0AB,2004,125000      
AL10 0AB,2013,220000      
AL10 0AB,2014,180000
